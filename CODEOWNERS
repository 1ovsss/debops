# This is a GitHub CODEOWNERS file, which uses a syntax similar to the
# '.gitignore' file to define the reviewers of certain files or directories in
# the repository. Order of the entries is important, the last matching entry
# wins. You can read more about how this file works at
# https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# Reviewers can be added into "teams" according to their interests, each
# reviewer is identified by their GitHub username to allow for GitHub to notify
# them on changes in their selected files. If you are registered as a reviewer
# here, you are expected to perform reviews of pull requests to the repository
# in a reasonable time, usually a week. If a review might take longer, leave
# a comment so that we know that you want to do it.
#
# Available teams:
# - Documentation: drybjed, tasosalvas
# - Security (DebOps Security Policy): drybjed, ypid
# - Self-hosting (etesync, debops-contrib.*): ypid


# Global, default reviewers for everything in the repository
