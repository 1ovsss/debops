# should be a string or a YAML list of FQDN addresses or hostnames. Example:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#    netbase__hosts:
#      '192.0.2.1': [ 'router.example.org', 'router' ]

# Ansible module. This allows the database to be updated by other mechanisms
# than Ansible, but the configuration is very slow. This is suitable for small
# number of host entries, otherwise you should think about setting up a local
# DNS server instead.
#
# If ``template``, the hosts database will be generated using the ``template``
# Ansible module. This makes the configuration much faster, which is useful
# with large list of hosts, but the database cannot be modified by other tools,
# the changes will not be preserved by Ansible.
