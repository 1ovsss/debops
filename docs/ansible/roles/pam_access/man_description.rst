Description
===========

The `Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules`__ provide dynamic authentication
support to services on Linux hosts. The ``debops.pam_access`` role can be used
to manage one aspect of PAM - access control rules that can be used to grant or
revoke access to services based on users, groups and origins.
